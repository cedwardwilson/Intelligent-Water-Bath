; File Overview:
; Contains an interrupt routine that counts every second (actually 1.04seconds)
; Within the interrupt, data is taken if 10 interrupts have run since the last
; data reading
; This data is sent to the UART (so it appears in the serial port terminal)
	
	; External and global routines/variables
	global	    SecondTimer, DataLow, DataHigh, DataTop, DataUp
	extern	    TimerCount, DataCount, TimeL, TimeH
	
	; Named variables in Access Ram
acs0    udata_acs		    
DataTop	    res 1			; To send the highest digit to UART
DataHigh    res 1			; To send the next digit to UART
DataUp	    res 1			; To send the next digit to UART
DataLow	    res 1			; To send the lowest digit to UART
	    
    ; int_hi:
    ; A high priority interrupt that is called every 1.04 seconds whilst the 
    ; code runs
    ; Sends the current temperature reading to the serial port terminal, such
    ; that it can be graphed in a python script

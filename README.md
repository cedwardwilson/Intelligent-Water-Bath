Once the system is turned on, the user must input a time or temperature on the keypad. This will be in the format XY.Z (user will input X Y Z) - as a temperature this will be read in degrees Celsius and as a time this will be read in minutes
When prompted, the user must select a method of operation (A, B, C). 
Method A: the heater will be on until the water hits the desired temperature.
Method B: the heater will be on so that it reaches equilibrium at the desired temperature.
Method C: the heater will be on for a desired time.

To restart the system, or select another method, the user must press the reset button on the PIC18 board and begin the process again.
